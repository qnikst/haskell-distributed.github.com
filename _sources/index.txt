Welcome to Haskell Distributed's documentation!
===============================================

Cloud Haskell: Erlang-style concurrent and distributed programming in Haskell.
The Cloud Haskell Platform consists of a generic :hackage-pkg:`network transport API <network-transport>`,
:hackage-pkg:`libraries <distributed-static>` for sending static closures to remote nodes,
a rich :hackage-pkg:`API <distributed-process>` for distributed programming and a set of
Platform Libraries, modelled after Erlangâ€™s Open Telecom Platform.

Generic network transport backends have been developed for TCP and in-memory messaging,
and several other implementations are available including a transport for Windows Azure.
